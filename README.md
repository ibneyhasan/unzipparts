unzipparts
==========

**start unzipping before you have all the parts.**

the parts are streamed rather than pre-concatenated on disk, which is good if you're short on space.

requires: jython  
usage: pass in the filenames of the parts of the zip you've got. the last part doesn't even have to be complete.
